			Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

	<h2>What's Fun About This Game?</h2>
		<p>The fact that it exists and is clearly very complex are both strong attributes of the game. In addition, Memory Game is part of the GA course I am completing, which should convince you, the user, if nothing else could, to play this game.</p>
	<h2>Who made this damned game?</h2>
	<p>Apparently it is I, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bethswingler/">Beth</a>, who will have made this game.</p>
